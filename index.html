        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          A family member of mine who runs their own company needed a way to monitor their business metrics more efficiently. They had very specific requirements for a custom dashboard layout that standard software couldn't provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          While their business has specific internal rules for how data should be handled and interpreted, the off-the-shelf software they were using was too rigid; it couldn't be programmed to follow their unique logic, forcing them to perform many checks and "tests" manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were looking for a solution that could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate automated reports that are easy to read, allowing them to share insights with their team without spending hours writing summaries.</li>
          <li>Create custom graphs with specific design features and layouts that simply weren't available in standard business tools.</li>
          <li>Implement quick filtering to navigate large amounts of data with ease.</li>
          <li>Centralize and automate their workflow to save time and reduce the daily administrative burden.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          The custom graph maker I developed provides all the specific layout features they need, offering total freedom over how their business data is visualized.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it accessible, I ensured that data can be filtered with just a single line of code. Furthermore, for a non-coder, I've made it possible to integrate the ChatGPT API, allowing them to filter and query their data using natural language.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the data monitoring side, the program automatically runs all the necessary checks according to the company's specific quality policy. The script produces clear, custom visuals and straightforward reports that answer the vital questions: Is the business hitting its targets? If so, by how much? If not, why?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some outputs plots made with the descriptive statistics script. The different color coding for histogram or box plots allows easier visualization of data, the numbers on top of each columns is a feature that is not available on the software my client was working with for scatterplots or lineplots, you can choose to add a regression line to the plot. In the same way, it is possible to apply a hue or not to the distribution plot. Those seemingly small features when added up, allow to be way more efficient for repetitive work.

          Here is the output of the 1 sample t-test made with the inferential statistics script. Inferential statistics tests work with assumptions, we have to verify if they are fulfilled in order for the test to be reliable, they tend to vary in between different tests, here it's a normality test that needs to be passed. The program selects automatically the best fitted test of normality for the sample among 3 different ones, here Shapiro-wilk is the best fit and will give the better estimation of normality. The expected mean is 0.18, the sample is normal and the P value is 0.08. H0 is accepted.

For this test, each assumptions builds the correct test automatically depending on the results of each precedent test. Here levene's test is used for equality of variances because one of the sample is not normal, the test is more robust than Bartlett's, the other alternative. The test for equality of means is Welch's t test instead of the independent 2 sample t-test because Welch's test is more robust for inequality in variances. A warning appeared stating that one of the sample is not normal, and that the results might not represent reality as the equality of means test is a parametric test.

        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          The implementation of these two Python scripts has significantly reduced errors by automating assumptions and limiting redundant manual data entry. This has provided a steady, high-quality stream of data for their entire team to rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program is highly intuitive and easy to integrate into a daily business routine. While some basic coding can be used for filtering, the ability to incorporate AI means that data filtering can be done via a simple text prompt. This makes the tool accessible to everyone in the company, regardless of their programming knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using this tool, my family member has been able to increase their productivity, reduce oversight errors, and bring much-needed stability to their business analysis. It has been a major "quality of life" improvement for their workday.

      <h1>Rupture Trend Analysis Tools</h1>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          While on an internship at a pharmaceutical company, I was asked to help managing ruptures of medicines.
        </p>
        <p>
          After noticing that no visuals were available for that subject, i decided to create a suite of tools that would give specific and general informations about ruptures
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a table filled with dates was provided to my department for rupture analysis, being quite visual myself and knowing a lot of people aren't quite abstract enough to imagine ruptures trough some dates, a visualization tool for this purpose was needed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          For a general analysis, I made a python script that gives a graph of the evolution of ruptures since the beginning of the database with the possibility to Filters by canals or by complete ruptures only. A simple, first but necessary step into the rupture trend analysis.
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-section">
          <p>
            Here are 4 different graphs, the first one shows the evolution of ruptures over time, the second one represents the evolution of complete rupture over time the last one displays the evolution of ruptures on the distribution canal dedicated to exportation
          </p>
          <div class="image-grid-vertical">
            <img src="images/ruptures/Rupturecounts.png" alt="General rupture evolution over time">
            <img src="images/ruptures/RupturecountsComplète.png" alt="Complete rupture evolution over time">

            <img src="images/ruptures/RupturecountsExport.png" alt="Rupture evolution - Export distribution canal">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          For a more precise analysis, I made an excel based on the rupture's database that gives a visual representation as a yearly calendar for a specific year and reference number, with the possibility to add the same filters as the general analysis
        </p>
        <p>
          If the date is lit up = rupture<br>
          Date is not lit up = not rupture for that date
        </p>
        <p>
          *Distribution canal: groupement of clients regarding specific criterions
        </p>

        <div class="image-section">
          <p>
            Here are the calendars, all using the reference number 3910688 and the year 2024. the first calendar shows any ruptures in red. the second one shows complete ruptures in red. and partial ruptures in yellow for a more precise analysis , the 3 following one display the same reference for the same year but on specific distribution canals : Direct, hospital, export and Giphar, a french drugstore franchise.

        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          Both the python and excel files are really intuitive, easy to set up and easy to update, the python file could be entirely automated with the direct access of the database
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall analysis graphs are a great visual information for the evolution of ruptures over time, but the real deal Is the excel tool. It delivers quick visual informations that would require lots of work and time in between the database, mails, and excels otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ruptures of the company might not have been improve directly but the rupture and supply chain department are now more proficient with work and can have a visual representation that wasn't available before. They make better prevision, see trends of rupture directly which leads to better management of stocks.

      <h1>Management tool for the reception of goods</h1>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          During an Internship at the supply chain department of a company, I have been in charge of multiples redundant tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This particular task consisted in manually checking multiple documents to make sure trucks deliveries would go as planned but no tool was available For that purpose
        </p>
        <p>
          Up to 10 trucks per day could deliver merchandise to our warehouse but the process was often slowed down, always because of one specific document missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without it, the goods would pile up on the docks, annoying workers and slowing down the Flow of the reception process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those documents would be missing For 1 or 2 deliveries per day on average without supervision
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          The interface provided is extremely easy to understand, using color coding For specific purposes:
        </p>
        <p>
          Green = no need to check
        </p>
        <p>
          Red = need to ask For the supply chain planner associated [on the same line] to edit the doc
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow = different kind of document, Manual verification needed
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-section">
          <img src="images/verification_process/excel_br_info.png" alt="Excel interface screenshot showing color-coded verification tool" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; display: block; margin: 30px auto; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
        </div>
        
        <p>
          The excel File takes a CV input which is an extraction of the orders heading to the warehouse as well as data regarding document generation from my e-mails, it then performs a double verification between reference and batch number
        </p>
        <p>
          Each line represent a different delivery with key informations about it on the left of the table and wether the document are edited or not on the right
        </p>
        <p>
          The batch numbers 310G27 3110G27 and PA2188 are in red, this shows that no confirmation emails have been sent, hence explicitly showing that the documents aren't edited yet. I need to inform the associated planner that they need to create them.
        </p>
        <p>
          « EPM adamed » is in yellow so I had to verify manually if the docs were edited for this specific delivery
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          This File allowed to significantly reduce my workload (30 to 45 min per day) allowing me to work on more purposeful projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was able to tell planners For up to 7 days prior delivery to edit the document, giving a larger timeframe to solve the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reception Flux at the warehouse never have been more Fluid, almost 15 to 20% of deliveries were interrupted before, after implantation of this solution, up to 99% of deliveries due to TMS issues
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, the department got substantial gain in productivity, enhanced the reception flux by a substantial amount, and I managed to gained up to 45 minutes per day for me to address more interesting subjects at this internship.

      <h1>Add-on for an accountant specific ERP</h1>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          MyUnisoft is an ERP company specialized in accounting firms. A friend of mine who is working there proposed me this project after multiple clients asked for a specific feature : which clients and which accountants are profitable and on which tasks ? 
        </p>
        <p>
          The stakes here are high, this feature would allow to re-evaluate contracts with clients, transfer knowledge and create new standardized methods if an accountant is noticeably better than the others at a specific task or even ease the distribution of bonuses to the good elements. Overall this feature is a big 'Nice to have' for big companies and it could be a 'Must have' for smaller firms.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          The script needs 3 inputs as system arguments : the name of the client, as well as a beginning and an end date to select a timeframe for the analysis. The name of the client is verified in the internal database and if he exists it search for his API key. As the database structure is the same for all clients, the script performs multiple transformations and merges to get the data, which is then injected into a default excel template that is given in the output. Each accountant firm can ask for a specialized excel template if they want to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excel is known by everyone in white collar jobs, hence why we decided to use it as a support for the output. The template comes with several pivot tables, allowing to compare accountant on tasks, for which client they are profitable, how much time they spend on those tasks, which client is profitable, compare them…
        </p>
        <p>
          it is also possible to apply filters : fiscal year, expert accountant associated, only taking into account time element with no billing and vice versa, as well as sorting the tables using specific criteria.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="test-section">
        <h3>Basic pivot table use</h3>
        <p>
          Here is the output of two pivot tables, client / operation, as well as accountant / operation, with no filters, 
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see 4 columns for each accountant, 2 hourly and 2 absolute values columns. As well as 'prix de vente' and 'valorisation'. The 'valorisation' corresponds to the price rate that which the accounting firm pays his accountant. The 'prix de vente' is the amount the accounting firm expects the client to pay when lending an accountant. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The excel template automatically applies conditional formatting to the values for ease of reading
        </p>
        <p>
          The bonus or malus on the 'prix de vente' or 'valorisation' is the difference in between the expected payements and the actual facturation, here is a small example :
        </p>
        <p>
          An accountant 'X' has a V of 50$/hour and the PDV is 75$/hour, he spends 2 hours on a task for which the client pays him 300$. 
        </p>
        <p>
          His absolute bonus or malus (bonimali) for his V is 300 - 2*50 = 200$
        </p>
        <p>
          His absolute bonimali for pdv is 300 - 2*75 = 150$
        </p>
        <p>
          His hourly bonimali for his V is 300/2 - 50 = 100$
        </p>
        <p>
          His hourly bonimali for pdv is 300/2 - 75 = 75$
        </p>
        <p>
          For this task, this accountant generated a net bonus of 200$ for the accounting firm, he also generated 150$ more than what is expected of him for this task 
        </p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="test-section">
        <h3>Filtering</h3>
        <p>
          Here is another pivot table comparing accountant bonuses on their respective clients. Here, a filter is applied and only billing elements with no time spent are shown, as you can see the hourly bonimalis are all zeros but the absolutes bonimalis are positive.
        </p>
        <img src="images/MYU/collab_client_filtre_temps_nul.png" alt="Excel output - Accountant bonuses filtered by zero time">
      </div>

      <div class="test-section">
        <h3>Sorting</h3>
        <p>
          Here is the last pivot table available in the standard template, it shows everything, the tasks, the clients and the accountant as well as the time spent on the tasks, here it is filtered from lowest ro largest on the absolute bonimali for the PDV.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our accountant made a bonus of 10833.34€ on Yves Saint Laurent without working at all , gaining 5000€ on 2 tasks : « Travaux clôture » and « Budget Juridique » but he had a malus of -800€ for Absence Cabinet. 
        </p>

      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          This add-on allows for good monitoring in accounting firms, the support is easily accessible and modular as pivot tables are widely used and understood.
