          Hello, I am Hugo a French student in mechanical and electrical engineering. 
          I have developed an interest in programming and especially data analysis on 
          the side of my studies. This is my portfolio of all my interesting projects 
          regarding this subject ranging from analysis, automations, QOL enhancement 
          or even lucrative projects. Enjoy the ride !

        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          A family member of mine who runs their own company needed a way to monitor their business metrics more efficiently. They had very specific requirements for a custom dashboard layout that standard software couldn't provide.
        </p>
        <p>
          While their business has specific internal rules for how data should be handled and interpreted, the off-the-shelf software they were using was too rigid; it couldn't be programmed to follow their unique logic, forcing them to perform many checks and "tests" manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were looking for a solution that could:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generate automated reports that are easy to read, allowing them to share insights with their team without spending hours writing summaries.</li>
          <li>Create custom graphs with specific design features and layouts that simply weren't available in standard business tools.</li>
          <li>Implement quick filtering to navigate large amounts of data with ease.</li>
          <li>Centralize and automate their workflow to save time and reduce the daily administrative burden.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          The custom graph maker I developed provides all the specific layout features they need, offering total freedom over how their business data is visualized.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make it accessible, I ensured that data can be filtered with just a single line of code. Furthermore, for a non-coder, I've made it possible to integrate the ChatGPT API, allowing them to filter and query their data using natural language.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the data monitoring side, the program automatically runs all the necessary checks according to the company's specific quality policy. The script produces clear, custom visuals and straightforward reports that answer the vital questions: Is the business hitting its targets? If so, by how much? If not, why?
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are some outputs plots made with the descriptive statistics script. The different color coding for histogram or box plots allows easier visualization of data, the numbers on top of each columns is a feature that is not available on the software my client was working with for scatterplots or lineplots, you can choose to add a regression line to the plot. In the same way, it is possible to apply a hue or not to the distribution plot. Those seemingly small features when added up, allow to be way more efficient for repetitive work.

          Here is the output of the 1 sample t-test made with the inferential statistics script. Inferential statistics tests work with assumptions, we have to verify if they are fulfilled in order for the test to be reliable, they tend to vary in between different tests, here it's a normality test that needs to be passed. The program selects automatically the best fitted test of normality for the sample among 3 different ones, here Shapiro-wilk is the best fit and will give the better estimation of normality. The expected mean is 0.18, the sample is normal and the P value is 0.08. H0 is accepted.

For this test, each assumptions builds the correct test automatically depending on the results of each precedent test. Here levene's test is used for equality of variances because one of the sample is not normal, the test is more robust than Bartlett's, the other alternative. The test for equality of means is Welch's t test instead of the independent 2 sample t-test because Welch's test is more robust for inequality in variances. A warning appeared stating that one of the sample is not normal, and that the results might not represent reality as the equality of means test is a parametric test.

        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          The implementation of these two Python scripts has significantly reduced errors by automating assumptions and limiting redundant manual data entry. This has provided a steady, high-quality stream of data for their entire team to rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program is highly intuitive and easy to integrate into a daily business routine. While some basic coding can be used for filtering, the ability to incorporate AI means that data filtering can be done via a simple text prompt. This makes the tool accessible to everyone in the company, regardless of their programming knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using this tool, my family member has been able to increase their productivity, reduce oversight errors, and bring much-needed stability to their business analysis. It has been a major "quality of life" improvement for their workday.

      <h1>Rupture Trend Analysis Tools</h1>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
        <p>
          While on an internship at a pharmaceutical company, I was asked to help managing ruptures of medicines.
        </p>
        <p>
          After noticing that no visuals were available for that subject, i decided to create a suite of tools that would give specific and general informations about ruptures
        </p>
        <p>
          Only a table filled with dates was provided to my department for rupture analysis, being quite visual myself and knowing a lot of people aren't quite abstract enough to imagine ruptures trough some dates, a visualization tool for this purpose was needed.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section-bubble">
        <h2>THE PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          For a general analysis, I made a python script that gives a graph of the evolution of ruptures since the beginning of the database with the possibility to Filters by canals or by complete ruptures only. A simple, first but necessary step into the rupture trend analysis.
        </p>
        
        <div class="image-section">
          <p>
            Here are 4 different graphs, the first one shows the evolution of ruptures over time, the second one represents the evolution of complete rupture over time the last one displays the evolution of ruptures on the distribution canal dedicated to exportation
          </p>
          <div class="image-grid">
            <img src="images/ruptures/Rupturecounts.png" alt="General rupture evolution over time">
            <img src="images/ruptures/RupturecountsComplète.png" alt="Complete rupture evolution over time">

            <img src="images/ruptures/RupturecountsExport.png" alt="Rupture evolution - Export distribution canal">
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          For a more precise analysis, I made an excel based on the rupture's database that gives a visual representation as a yearly calendar for a specific year and reference number, with the possibility to add the same filters as the general analysis
        </p>
        <p>
          If the date is lit up = rupture<br>
          Date is not lit up = not rupture for that date
        </p>
        <p>
          *Distribution canal: groupement of clients regarding specific criterions
        </p>

        <div class="image-section">
          <p>
            Here are the calendars, all using the reference number 3910688 and the year 2024. the first calendar shows any ruptures in red. the second one shows complete ruptures in red. and partial ruptures in yellow for a more precise analysis , the 3 following one display the same reference for the same year but on specific distribution canals : Direct, hospital, export and Giphar, a french drugstore franchise.

        <h2>RESULTS</h2>
        <p>
          Both the python and excel files are really intuitive, easy to set up and easy to update, the python file could be entirely automated with the direct access of the database
        </p>
        <p>
          The overall analysis graphs are a great visual information for the evolution of ruptures over time, but the real deal Is the excel tool. It delivers quick visual informations that would require lots of work and time in between the database, mails, and excels otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ruptures of the company might not have been improve directly but the rupture and supply chain department are now more proficient with work and can have a visual representation that wasn't available before. They make better prevision, see trends of rupture directly which leads to better management of stocks.
