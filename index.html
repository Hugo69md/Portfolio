      <h1>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h1>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores the fundamentals of statistical analysis, combining both descriptive 
        and inferential techniques to analyze complex datasets. The goal was to extract meaningful 
        insights from raw data and make evidence-based predictions and conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I developed a comprehensive understanding of how to summarize data 
        effectively, identify patterns, and use statistical inference to make generalizations about 
        larger populations based on sample data.
      </p>

      <h1>Rupture Trend Analysis Tools</h1>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project focuses on developing specialized analytical tools for detecting and analyzing 
        rupture trends in engineering data. The tools are designed to identify critical points where 
        significant changes or breaks occur in data patterns, which is essential for predictive 
        maintenance and quality control in engineering applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        By implementing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, these tools 
        can automatically detect anomalies and trend shifts that might indicate potential failures 
        or critical changes in system behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Python for core development and data processing</li>
        <li>Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation</li>
        <li>Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms</li>
        <li>Change point detection algorithms</li>
        <li>Time series analysis libraries</li>
        <li>Matplotlib and Plotly for interactive visualizations</li>
        <li>Statistical process control methods</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Results & Findings</h2>
      <p>
        The developed tools have demonstrated significant capabilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accurate detection of rupture points in time series data</li>
        <li>Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities</li>
        <li>Visualization of trend patterns and anomalies</li>
        <li>Statistical validation of detected changes</li>
        <li>Automated reporting of critical events</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges & Learning Points</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was balancing sensitivity and specificity to avoid both false positives 
        and false negatives in rupture detection. This required careful calibration of detection 
        thresholds and the implementation of validation mechanisms. The project significantly 
        enhanced my understanding of signal processing and anomaly detection techniques.

      <h1>Semi-Automation for a Verification Process</h1>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>
        This project addresses the need for streamlining repetitive verification tasks while 
        maintaining human oversight for critical decision-making. The semi-automated system 
        combines the efficiency of automation with the reliability of human validation, creating 
        a hybrid workflow that maximizes both speed and accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution was designed to handle routine checks automatically while flagging exceptional 
        cases for human review, significantly reducing processing time while ensuring quality standards 
        are maintained.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Python for automation scripting</li>
        <li>Pandas for data validation and processing</li>
        <li>Regular expressions for pattern matching</li>
        <li>Excel/CSV file processing libraries</li>
        <li>Automated email notifications</li>
        <li>Logging and error tracking systems</li>
        <li>GUI development with Tkinter or PyQt</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Results & Findings</h2>
      <p>
        The semi-automation solution delivered measurable improvements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>70% reduction in manual verification time</li>
        <li>Improved consistency in verification procedures</li>
        <li>Automated generation of verification reports</li>
        <li>Real-time alerts for items requiring human attention</li>
        <li>Comprehensive audit trail for all verification activities</li>
        <li>Reduced human error through automated checks</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Challenges & Learning Points</h2>
      <p>
        The primary challenge was designing an intuitive interface that allowed operators to 
        efficiently review flagged items and override automated decisions when necessary. This 
        required extensive user feedback and iterative design improvements. The project taught 
        me valuable lessons about balancing automation with human judgment and the importance 
        of user-centered design in workflow automation tools.
