    <h1>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores the fundamentals of statistical analysis, combining both descriptive 
      and inferential techniques to analyze complex datasets. The goal was to extract meaningful 
      insights from raw data and make evidence-based predictions and conclusions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this project, I developed a comprehensive understanding of how to summarize data 
      effectively, identify patterns, and use statistical inference to make generalizations about 
      larger populations based on sample data.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python for data analysis and statistical computing</li>
      <li>Pandas for data manipulation and analysis</li>
      <li>NumPy for numerical computations</li>
      <li>Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization</li>
      <li>SciPy for statistical functions and hypothesis testing</li>
      <li>Jupyter Notebook for interactive development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Results & Findings</h2>
    <p>
      The project successfully demonstrated proficiency in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Calculating and interpreting measures of central tendency and variability</li>
      <li>Creating effective visualizations to communicate statistical findings</li>
      <li>Performing hypothesis testing and confidence interval estimation</li>
      <li>Understanding probability distributions and their applications</li>
      <li>Drawing valid conclusions from statistical analysis</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Learning Points</h2>
    <p>
      One of the main challenges was ensuring the appropriate selection of statistical tests 
      based on data characteristics and research questions. This project enhanced my ability 
      to think critically about data assumptions and the validity of statistical methods.
