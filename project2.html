    <h1>Rupture Trend Analysis Tools</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
      This project focuses on developing specialized analytical tools for detecting and analyzing 
      rupture trends in engineering data. The tools are designed to identify critical points where 
      significant changes or breaks occur in data patterns, which is essential for predictive 
      maintenance and quality control in engineering applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      By implementing advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms, these tools 
      can automatically detect anomalies and trend shifts that might indicate potential failures 
      or critical changes in system behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Python for core development and data processing</li>
      <li>Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation</li>
      <li>Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms</li>
      <li>Change point detection algorithms</li>
      <li>Time series analysis libraries</li>
      <li>Matplotlib and Plotly for interactive visualizations</li>
      <li>Statistical process control methods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Results & Findings</h2>
    <p>
      The developed tools have demonstrated significant capabilities:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Accurate detection of rupture points in time series data</li>
      <li>Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities</li>
      <li>Visualization of trend patterns and anomalies</li>
      <li>Statistical validation of detected changes</li>
      <li>Automated reporting of critical events</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges & Learning Points</h2>
    <p>
      The main challenge was balancing sensitivity and specificity to avoid both false positives 
      and false negatives in rupture detection. This required careful calibration of detection 
      thresholds and the implementation of validation mechanisms. The project significantly 
      enhanced my understanding of signal processing and anomaly detection techniques.
